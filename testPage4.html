                Great fear for hurricane Dorian. It's the biggest
                of the last 50 years, experts say. After devastating
                the Bahamas, Dorian is expected to move to the US,
                hitting heavily Florida's Keys and then the mainland.
                President Trump declared emergency status and evacuated
                more than a million people. New bulletins will follow.
